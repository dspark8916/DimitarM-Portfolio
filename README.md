## What is a Portfolio?

A Portfolio is more than just a simple resume, it's a showcase that proves that you can do what you talk about in your resume. Instead of just telling prospective employers about your skills when you create a Portfolio you can actually show them!! A well-rounded Portfolio is a vital asset that can make all the difference when you're competing with other hopefuls for a coveted job. Not only does it act as a showcase for your previous work, but the site itself is an example of what you can do. Even beyond just that, with a Portfolio you have the ability to craft your personal brand and give potential employers a better understanding of how you may fit in within their company culture and whether you'd be successful in the role they're looking to fill. All in all, it is very imperative to create as great a portfolio as you can!!
